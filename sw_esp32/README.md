# ESP32 software for NMEA Bluetooth connection
The ESP32 received from the STM32 generated NMEA Data via UART and forwards this data via Bluetooth and via a second UART interface to the RS232 transceiver.

## Flashing the ESP32 firmware
- Flash the *.ino file with arduino studio via the esp32 usb connector
- Arduino IDE configuration
    - Select a **ESP32 Dev Module** board.
    - The Sensor uses a 8MByte ESP32 chip
